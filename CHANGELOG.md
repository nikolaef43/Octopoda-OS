# Changelog

## 3.1.6 (2026-05-08)

### Critical bugfix — local SQLite unbounded growth
- `runtime:agents:*` heartbeat and state writes were never being garbage-collected. Each agent writes ~3 rows/sec to this prefix; without GC the SQLite `nodes` table grew unboundedly, eventually causing background-thread queries to spin CPU and freeze the daemon. One reported case had this single prefix at 2.2M of 4.1M total rows. Now pruned by default (`runtime_agents_days=1`, configurable via `SYNRIX_GC_RUNTIME_AGENTS_DAYS`). Fixes #6.
- Existing local DBs that already grew past a few hundred thousand rows will see significant cleanup on the first GC cycle after upgrade. Plan for that cycle to take a few extra seconds; subsequent cycles return to normal.

### Audit chain integrity
- `verify_chain` now tracks expected `prev_hash` per agent rather than globally, fixing a long-standing false negative when the global view crossed agent boundaries. Returns a `by_agent` breakdown alongside the overall result. The historical chain was always intact; only the verifier was wrong.

### Misc
- All package `__version__` constants now match `pyproject.toml`. They had drifted across `octopoda`, `synrix`, `synrix_runtime` historically (3.1.4 / 3.1.0 / 3.1.0).
- README updated with the full MCP tool reference (the actual exposed names after `claude mcp add octopoda`), the Python version note for the `[mcp]` extra, and the local dashboard hero screenshot refreshed.
- CI smoke matrix dropped Python 3.9 because `mcp>=1.0.0` requires Python 3.10+. Core `octopoda` still installs on 3.9 — only the optional `[mcp]` extra needs 3.10+.
- CI test assertions updated for the rebrand (`SYNRIX_LICENSE_KEY` → `OCTOPODA_LICENSE_KEY`, `synrix.io/pricing` → `octopodas.com/pricing`, version-pinning removed from `test_health`).

## 3.1.1 (2026-04-17)

### Critical bugfix — fixes silent activation failures
Two production bugs were silently blocking ~67% of new users from writing their first memory. Audit found 11 silent-failure sites total. This release:

- **Null-byte write corruption fixed.** `add_node` silently failed whenever user data contained `\u0000` (common in LLM output, byte-level tokenizer artifacts, binary-ish data). Postgres JSONB rejects `\u0000` even though it's legal JSON; the old error handler caught it, logged to a channel nobody watched, and returned None — the write *appeared* to succeed but nothing was stored. Fixed two ways:
  1. `_sanitize_for_pg_json()` strips `\u0000` before INSERT.
  2. A psycopg2 string-adapter registered at pool init strips NUL bytes from *every* string en route to Postgres. Belt-and-braces defense that prevents any future call site from regressing.
- **Timeline 500 error fixed.** `GET /v1/agents/{id}/timeline` and `/checkpoints` crashed with `TypeError: '<' not supported between 'str' and 'int'` when events had mixed timestamp types. Sort keys now coerce to float with 0.0 fallback.
- **Stripe webhook hardening.** Signature parser now rejects missing/malformed `Stripe-Signature` headers cleanly instead of crashing into the error path.

### Knowledge-graph reliability
- `_store_extraction` previously silently dropped relationships whenever entity writes failed (returned 0). Now every failed entity/relationship logs with context (name, type, source_node_id), and a summary line is emitted for any batch where failures occurred. KG pipeline is no longer invisible.

### Observability
- Added `_report_to_sentry()` helper used by every caught-and-swallowed DB-write exception in `postgres_client.py` (add_fact_embeddings, update_node_embedding, upsert_entity, add_relationship). Failures now surface in Sentry with `db_op` + `tenant_id` tags.
- Added `_capture_silent()` helper for the server-side non-blocking paths (licensing tracking, auto-snapshot, brain monitoring, TTL cleanup). These still don't block the user request but now surface in Sentry.
- Richer SDK-layer logging in `agent_backend.py` (3 sites previously had `except Exception: return 0` with zero logging).

### New admin endpoints
- `GET /v1/admin/activation` — cohort activation report (signups vs verified vs api-used vs actually-wrote-memory, per 24h/7d/30d/all-time window). Health flagged as `critical` when <10% activation, `degraded` <20%, `healthy` >=20%. Built on a new `admin_cohort_activation()` SECURITY DEFINER function so it bypasses RLS cleanly.
- `GET /v1/admin/health` — end-to-end smoke test that exercises register → write-with-null-byte → recall → shared → log_decision → snapshot → cleanup. Regression canary for the null-byte bug and every critical write path. Run manually or from a cron.
- `GET /v1/admin/billing/overview` — paid tenants, MRR/ARR, recent Stripe events (shipped in 3.1.0, documented here).

### Billing emails (shipped mid-3.1.0, documented here)
- Customer emails on: upgrade (welcome), cancellation (confirmation), payment failure (warning).
- Owner notifications to `OWNER_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` env (default `joe@octopodas.com`) on: upgrade, plan change, cancellation, payment failure.
- All sends are best-effort (wrapped in try/except, never break the webhook response).

### Schema additions
- `tenants.stripe_customer_id`, `tenants.stripe_subscription_id` — added via `ALTER TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` and in `init.sql`. Without these, `_upgrade_tenant()` would crash on the SQL UPDATE after a real payment and silently leave the customer on `free` tier.

## 3.1.0 (2026-04-16)

### Highlights since 3.0.9

**Neural Brain — 3D Agent Visualization** (new hero feature)

Real-time 3D view of agent activity powered by react-force-graph-3d with Three.js bloom post-processing. Every memory write, decision, loop alert, and cross-agent write becomes a node. Click any node to see the full event with its memory snapshot. Time scrubber replays any 24h window. Mobile fallback to 2D force graph. Backed by 9 `/v1/brain/*` endpoints.

**Integration kwargs now work** — three documented parameters that were silently accepted via `**kwargs` and ignored:
- `LangChainMemory(session_id=...)` — each session_id now gets isolated message storage. `RunnableWithMessageHistory` multi-session patterns work correctly.
- `LangChainMemory(return_messages=True)` — returns `list[HumanMessage | AIMessage]` instead of a concatenated string. Required for chat models.
- `CrewAIMemory(crew_name=...)` — was raising `TypeError`. Now accepted as an optional identifier.

**MCP client fixes** (affects every Claude Desktop / Cursor / Windsurf user):
- Fixed base URL typo `api.octapodas.com` → `api.octopodas.com` (previously worked by DNS accident)
- Non-2xx API responses now raise descriptive errors. Silent swallow was hiding 403 "agent limit reached" — users hit the free-tier 5-agent cap, every `remember` call reported success, but nothing was stored. That path is now loud.
- Install: `pip install octopoda[mcp]` (bare install didn't include the `mcp` Python package).

**Bundled dashboard updated** — the `synrix_runtime/dashboard/static/` shipped with the wheel now matches octopodas.com: Neural Brain, Audit Trail, Shared Memory tabs. Previous wheels shipped an April 8 build.

**Documentation** — README redesigned with Neural Brain screenshot, dedicated Audit Trail and Shared Memory sections, collapsed framework integrations. 8 stale pre-Octopoda-era docs removed. Every README code block verified end-to-end against the live SDK with real LangChain/CrewAI/AutoGen/OpenAI Agents calls.

### New Features

### Loop Detection v2 (Major Upgrade)

Complete rewrite from single-check to multi-signal intelligence engine:
- **5 detection signals**: write similarity, key overwrites, velocity spikes, alert frequency, goal drift
- **Escalating severity**: green (healthy) → yellow (minor) → orange (significant) → red (critical)
- **Actionable recovery**: every signal includes what's happening, why, and exactly what to do
