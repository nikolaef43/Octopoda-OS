## What is Octopoda

Octopoda is the missing layer between your AI agents and a working production system. Think of it as the brain stem your agents always needed but never had.

You write your agent however you like. Pure Python, LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, OpenAI Agents SDK, MCP. Octopoda sits underneath and quietly handles the boring stuff that makes agents actually usable. Persistent memory that survives every restart. Loop detection that catches a stuck agent in seconds, before it burns through your token budget overnight. A full audit trail of every decision, every memory write, every recovery. A live dashboard that finally lets you see what your agents are doing.

It runs locally with one `pip install` and zero infrastructure. When you outgrow that, the same code syncs to the cloud with a single environment variable. No re-architecture, no migration, no lock-in. The whole thing is open source under MIT.

If you have ever shipped an AI agent and watched it forget who you are, loop on a failing API call for hours, or just disappear into a black box you cannot debug, this is the thing you wished existed.

---

## Why Octopoda

Three things go wrong when AI agents leave your laptop. Octopoda handles all three out of the box, with no config, so you can focus on the agent and not the plumbing.

**Agents forget, until they do not.** Every time your process restarts, your agent loses everything it ever knew about the user, the task, and the conversation. Octopoda gives every agent persistent memory that survives restarts, crashes, deployments, and process kills. Memory just works, the way you always assumed it would.

**Agents loop, and silently burn money.** A stuck agent retrying a failing tool call can quietly burn hundreds of dollars in tokens before anyone notices. Octopoda's five signal loop detector catches retry, oscillation, ping pong, reflection, and recall write patterns in seconds, and surfaces exactly which calls caused it.

**Agents are black boxes, and that is terrifying in production.** Why did it do that? You had no idea, until now. Octopoda logs every decision, every write, every recovery into a hash chained audit trail you can replay, diff, and verify for tamper evidence. Pair it with the live 3D dashboard and you can finally see what your agents are doing in real time.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install octopoda
```

```python
from octopoda import AgentRuntime

agent = AgentRuntime("my_agent")
agent.remember("user_pref", "dark mode")
agent.recall("user_pref")
```

That's it. Your agent now has persistent memory, loop detection, crash recovery, and an audit trail. No config, no setup, no Docker. Memory survives restarts, crashes, and deployments — automatically.

### Want the dashboard?

```bash
pip install octopoda[server]
octopoda
```

Open **http://localhost:7842** — the same dashboard as the cloud version, running against your local data. No account, no API key.

### Want cloud sync?

Free at [octopodas.com](https://octopodas.com). Set the API key, same code, multi-device sync, team access.

```bash
export OCTOPODA_API_KEY=sk-octopoda-...
```

---

## Local vs Cloud — same code, your choice

|                        | Local                          | Cloud                          |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Setup                  | `pip install octopoda`         | Sign up at octopodas.com (free)|
| Storage                | SQLite on your machine         | PostgreSQL + pgvector          |
| Dashboard              | http://localhost:7842          | octopodas.com/dashboard        |
| Account                | Not needed                     | Free, then optional paid tiers |
| Multi-device sync      | No                             | Yes                            |
| Semantic search        | `octopoda[ai]` extra (33 MB)   | Built-in                       |
| Upgrade path           | Set `OCTOPODA_API_KEY`         | Already there                  |

Start local. Move to cloud when you need sync, team access, or the managed dashboard. Same Python API both ways.

## What You Get Out of the Box

When you create an `AgentRuntime`, all of this runs in the background, automatically:

| Feature             | What it does                                                              |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Persistent memory   | Survives restarts, crashes, deployments. Versioned by default.            |
| Loop detection      | 5-signal engine catches retry, oscillation, ping-pong, reflection, recall.|
| Audit trail         | Every write hashed and chained. Replayable, verifiable.                   |
| Crash recovery      | Automatic snapshots and heartbeat-based restore.                          |
| Health scoring      | Continuous performance and memory quality monitoring per agent.           |
| Drift tracking      | Goal alignment over time, with deviation alerts.                          |

You don't configure any of it. It just works.

---

## See Inside Your Agents

Track latency, error rates, memory usage, and health scores for every agent — with the same dashboard locally and in cloud.

![Agent Performance](docs/images/dashboard-performance.png)

Browse every memory the agent ever wrote, inspect version history, and see exactly how its knowledge changed over time.

![Memory Explorer](docs/images/memory-explorer.png)

---

## Audit Trail

Every decision, crash, recovery, and anomaly your agents make is logged with full context — including a memory snapshot captured at the moment of decision. Replay any time window and see exactly what each agent knew, decided, and why.

![Audit Trail](docs/images/audit-trail.png)

```python
agent.log_decision(
    decision="Keep single VPS instead of Kubernetes",
    reasoning="Current traffic doesn't justify K8s complexity. VPS handles 100x this load.",
    context={"current_rps": 14000, "threshold_rps": 1000000},
)
```

Every `log_decision` automatically captures a memory snapshot at that instant. The audit timeline shows decisions alongside crashes and recoveries, filterable per agent. Built-in similarity check warns you if a decision repeats a recent one.

Each event is hashed and chained (`prev_hash` → `_this_hash`), so the log is tamper-evident. Run `agent.verify_chain()` any time to confirm integrity.

---

## Shared Memory

Multiple agents working on the same problem can share knowledge through named memory spaces. Writes are atomic, reads are immediate, and every change is logged with its author — so you always know which agent contributed what.

![Shared Memory](docs/images/shared-memory.png)

```python
research_agent.share("market_size", "$2.1B AI memory market by 2027", space="team-knowledge")
result = coding_assistant.read_shared("market_size", space="team-knowledge")
print(result.value)  # "$2.1B AI memory market by 2027"
```

Spaces track authorship and timestamps for every write. Use `agent.shared_conflicts(space="team-knowledge")` to surface disagreements when multiple agents write to the same key.

---

## When You Need More Control

Everything below is optional. Use it when you need it.

### Semantic Search

Find memories by meaning, not just exact keys.

```python
agent.remember("bio", "Alice is a vegetarian living in London")
results = agent.recall_similar("what does the user eat?")
# Returns the right memory with a similarity score
```

### Agent Messaging

Agents can talk to each other through shared inboxes.

```python
agent_a.send_message("agent_b", "Found a bug in auth", message_type="alert")
messages = agent_b.read_messages(unread_only=True)
```

### Goal Tracking

Set goals and track progress. Integrates with drift detection.

```python
agent.set_goal("Migrate to PostgreSQL", milestones=["Backup", "Schema", "Migrate", "Validate"])
agent.update_progress(milestone_index=0, note="Backup done")
```

### Memory Management

```python
agent.forget("outdated_config")                   # Delete a specific memory
agent.forget_stale(max_age_seconds=30*86400)      # Clean up memories older than 30 days
agent.consolidate(dry_run=False)                  # Merge near-duplicates
agent.memory_health()                             # Get a health report
```

### Snapshots and Recovery

```python
agent.snapshot("before_migration")
# ... something goes wrong ...
agent.restore("before_migration")
```

### Export / Import

```python
bundle = agent.export_memories()
new_agent.import_memories(bundle)
```

## Framework Integrations

Drop into the framework you already use. One line, your agents get persistent memory.

<details>
<summary><b>LangChain — drop-in conversation memory</b></summary>

```python
from octopoda import LangChainMemory
memory = LangChainMemory("my-chain")
memory.save_context({"input": "I prefer dark mode"}, {"output": "Got it!"})
variables = memory.load_memory_variables({})
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>CrewAI — persistent crew findings and task results</b></summary>

```python
from octopoda import CrewAIMemory
crew = CrewAIMemory("research-crew")
crew.store_finding("researcher", "market_size", {"value": "$4.2B"})
finding = crew.get_finding("market_size")
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>AutoGen — multi-agent conversation memory</b></summary>

```python
from octopoda import AutoGenMemory
memory = AutoGenMemory("dev-team")
memory.store_message("user_proxy", "assistant", "Research quantum computing")
history = memory.get_conversation_history()
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>OpenAI Agents SDK — thread and run persistence</b></summary>

```python
from octopoda import OpenAIAgentsMemory
memory = OpenAIAgentsMemory()
memory.store_thread_state("thread_001", {"messages": [...]})
restored = memory.restore_thread("thread_001")
```
</details>

All integrations work locally (no API key) or with cloud sync (set `OCTOPODA_API_KEY`).

---

## MCP Server

Give Claude, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible AI persistent memory with zero code.

```bash
pip install octopoda[mcp]
```

**Claude Code:**

```bash
claude mcp add octopoda -s user -e OCTOPODA_API_KEY=sk-octopoda-YOUR_KEY -- python -m synrix_runtime.api.mcp_server
```

**Claude Desktop** (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "octopoda": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "synrix_runtime.api.mcp_server"],
      "env": { "OCTOPODA_API_KEY": "sk-octopoda-YOUR_KEY" }
    }
  }
}
```

28 tools for memory, search, loop detection, goals, messaging, decisions, snapshots, and more.

<details>
<summary><b>Full MCP tool list (the names your agent will actually see)</b></summary>

When you register the server with `claude mcp add octopoda ...`, the MCP client prefixes each tool with the server name. So the tool that the function defines as `octopoda_remember` ends up exposed to your agent as `octopoda_octopoda_remember`. This is correct behaviour from the client; just be aware of it when you write skill files.

| Function name (server side) | Exposed name in client |
|---|---|
| `octopoda_remember` | `octopoda_octopoda_remember` |
| `octopoda_recall` | `octopoda_octopoda_recall` |
| `octopoda_search` | `octopoda_octopoda_search` |
| `octopoda_recall_similar` | `octopoda_octopoda_recall_similar` |
| `octopoda_recall_history` | `octopoda_octopoda_recall_history` |
| `octopoda_related` | `octopoda_octopoda_related` |
| `octopoda_snapshot` | `octopoda_octopoda_snapshot` |
| `octopoda_restore` | `octopoda_octopoda_restore` |
| `octopoda_share` | `octopoda_octopoda_share` |
| `octopoda_read_shared` | `octopoda_octopoda_read_shared` |
| `octopoda_list_agents` | `octopoda_octopoda_list_agents` |
| `octopoda_agent_stats` | `octopoda_octopoda_agent_stats` |
| `octopoda_process_conversation` | `octopoda_octopoda_process_conversation` |
| `octopoda_get_context` | `octopoda_octopoda_get_context` |
| `octopoda_log_decision` | `octopoda_octopoda_log_decision` |
| `octopoda_forget` | `octopoda_octopoda_forget` |
| `octopoda_forget_stale` | `octopoda_octopoda_forget_stale` |
| `octopoda_memory_health` | `octopoda_octopoda_memory_health` |
| `octopoda_consolidate` | `octopoda_octopoda_consolidate` |
| `octopoda_loop_status` | `octopoda_octopoda_loop_status` |
| `octopoda_loop_history` | `octopoda_octopoda_loop_history` |
| `octopoda_send_message` | `octopoda_octopoda_send_message` |
| `octopoda_read_messages` | `octopoda_octopoda_read_messages` |
| `octopoda_broadcast` | `octopoda_octopoda_broadcast` |
| `octopoda_set_goal` | `octopoda_octopoda_set_goal` |
| `octopoda_get_goal` | `octopoda_octopoda_get_goal` |
| `octopoda_update_progress` | `octopoda_octopoda_update_progress` |
| `octopoda_search_filtered` | `octopoda_octopoda_search_filtered` |

If you register the server with a different name (e.g. `claude mcp add memory ...`), the prefix changes to match. Use whichever name your client actually exposes when writing skill files; do not assume a single prefix.

## Installation

```bash
pip install octopoda              # Core — everything to get started (Python 3.9+)
pip install octopoda[ai]          # + Local embeddings for semantic search
pip install octopoda[server]      # + Local dashboard server (Flask)
pip install octopoda[nlp]         # + spaCy for knowledge graph extraction
pip install octopoda[mcp]         # + MCP server for Claude/Cursor (Python 3.10+)
pip install octopoda[all]         # Everything (Python 3.10+)
```

> **Python version note:** the core package supports Python 3.9 and up. The `[mcp]` extra requires Python 3.10+ because the upstream `mcp` library does. If you're on 3.9 and want everything except MCP, use `pip install octopoda[ai,server,nlp]`.
